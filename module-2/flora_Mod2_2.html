	<h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>
	<p class="tab"><span>Hi, I am Karissa Mae Flora.</span> I am 22 years old. I was born and raised in Omaha, NE. When I was born with a heart condition, in the womb, I was diagnosed with Hypoplastic Left Ventricle Syndrome. After being born, I was taken to be given an echo on my heart, where they found out I have Coarctation of the Aorta.</p>

	<p>I went to Metropolitan Community College, where I received an associate’s degree in computer programming. I graduated from MCC in May of 2023. After receiving my degree, I had trouble finding jobs having to do with my degree, so I decided to attend Bellevue University to continue on my degree.</p>

	<p>I am currently a full-time student at Bellevue University. Outside of having a passion for Computer programming, I have a love for dogs. When not studying or doing schoolwork, I am a full-time manager at a Pets Hotel.</p>

	<p>I am the first oldest in my family. I am also a first-generation college student. I have a younger brother who is going to school for a degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>
