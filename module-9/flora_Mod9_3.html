    <p><b> The Shawshank Redemption (1994) </b></p>
    <p> Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.
		Andy: Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.

		Red: I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. But still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.

		Andy: I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living, or get busy dying.

		Red: [narrating] I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at the start of a long journey, whose conclusion is uncertain. 
		 
		Andy: It's funny, Red. You know, on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.

		Red: [chuckles] I guess it comes down to a simple choice, doesn't it? Get busy living or get busy dying.

		Andy: Yeah. Only in here, sometimes, I feel like I'm still fighting to prove that I'm innocent.

		Red: We all need to believe in something, Andy. Right now, all I want is to get my hands on a cold <span id="aerial">_________</span>  and a fishing rod. Maybe catch me a big one, out in the Pacific.

		Andy: That sounds like heaven, Red. One day, when we're out there on the beaches of Zihuatanejo, we'll look back on this moment and laugh.

		Red: Yeah, we'll laugh, all right. And we'll thank ourselves for never giving up hope.

		Andy: Hope is what keeps us going, Red. No matter how tough it gets, we'll always have hope.</p>
